# NFA-to-DFA

Written for college's compiler course.

Provides a commandline interface to enter parameters for defining the NFA which is then used to generate an equivalent DFA. Epsilon-transitions are not taken into consideration.

Sample transition table (data entry of NFA omitted for brevity): 
```
**** NFA *****
State		Symbol	Output State
{q0}		a	{q0,q1}
{q0}		b	{q0}
{q1}		b	{q2}
**** DFA *****
State		Symbol	Output State
{q0}		a	{q0,q1}
{q0}		b	{q0}
{q0,q1}		a	{q0,q1}
{q0,q1}		b	{q0,q2}
{q0,q2}		a	{q0,q1}
{q0,q2}		b	{q0}

```
NFA transitions were given by user. DFA transitions were generated by the program.
